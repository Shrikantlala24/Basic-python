# 💱 Currency Converter

A simple Python script that converts currency between USD and EUR using fixed exchange rates.

## ✨ Features

* 🌐 Converts from USD to EUR
* 🌐 Converts from EUR to USD
* 🔧 Demonstrates basic input/output and function usage in Python

## 💻 Technologies Used

* 🐍 Python 3.x

## 🧐 How It Works

1. ✅ User is prompted to choose a conversion direction:

   * 1: USD to EUR
   * 2: EUR to USD
2. Based on the user's choice, the script:

   * ✏️ Takes input for the amount
   * 📈 Uses a hardcoded exchange rate
   * 📊 Calculates the converted amount using a function
   * 🖨️ Prints the result formatted to 2 decimal places

## 🌐 Example Exchange Rates (Hardcoded)

* 💵 1 USD = 0.85 EUR
* 💶 1 EUR = 1.18 USD

## 📃 Sample Output

```
Currency Converter
1. USD to EUR
2. EUR to USD
Enter your choice (1/2): 1
Enter amount in USD: 100
$100.00 USD is equal to €85.00 EUR
```

## ▶️ How to Run

1. 📥 Make sure Python 3 is installed.
2. 💾 Save the script as `currency_converter.py`.
3. 💻 Run it using the terminal:

```bash
python currency_converter.py
```

## 🚀 Future Improvements
