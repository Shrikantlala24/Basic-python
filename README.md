# 🐍 Basic Python Projects — A Beginner's Portfolio 🚀

Welcome to my collection of beginner-friendly Python projects!
This repository features a variety of mini tools, utility apps, and creative scripts that helped me build a strong and practical foundation in Python programming. From converters and calculators to games and generators — each project was crafted with curiosity and a passion for hands-on learning. 💡💻

These projects are not just practice exercises — they represent my evolving journey in programming, problem-solving, and logical thinking. They also reflect my commitment to building useful, working applications that could be part of real-world systems.

## 📂 Projects Overview

Below is a curated list of beginner-to-intermediate level Python projects, along with the core concepts, logic, and libraries involved in each one. I’ve categorized them by difficulty and skill areas to help both learners and reviewers understand the learning progression.

| Project Name                                     | Difficulty & Concepts Involved                               |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [To-Do List Application](./To-Do_List_app)            | 🟢 Easy — Lists, Loops, File Handling, CLI Interaction       |
| [Simple Calculator](./Calculator)         | 🟢 Easy — Arithmetic, Functions, Tkinter or CLI Input        |
| [Guess The Number Game](./Guess_number_game)           | 🟢 Easy — Random Module, Loops, Conditionals, User Feedback  |
| [URL Shortener](./url-shortener)                 | 🟡 Medium — APIs, String Manipulation, Requests Library      |
| [Temperature Converter](./Temperature_converter) | 🟢 Easy — Math Operations, Conditional Logic, Optional GUI   |
| [Random Quote Generator](./Random_Quote_generator)      | 🟡 Medium — API Integration, JSON Parsing, String Formatting |
| [QR Code Generator](./QR_Generator)         | 🟡 Medium — External Libraries (`qrcode`), Image Generation  |
| [Password Generator](./Password_generator)       | 🟡 Medium — Randomness, Character Sets, Loop Logic           |
| [Unit Converter](./Unit_converter)               | 🟢 Easy — Arithmetic, Input Validation, CLI/GUI Flexibility  |
| [Currency Converter](./Currency_converter)       | 🟡 Medium — Live Exchange API, Requests, Data Formatting     |

Each project is designed to be standalone, runnable, and easily understandable. You’ll find comments in the code where needed, and in future updates, I plan to add brief individual `README.md` files for each project as well.

## 🛠 Technologies and Tools Used

These projects were built using:

* **Python 3** 🐍 — The core programming language used for all logic and structure
* **Tkinter** — Used for graphical interfaces in select projects
* **Command-Line Interfaces (CLI)** — For simplicity and logic-focused programs
* **Python Standard Libraries** — Including:

  * `random`
  * `qrcode`
  * `requests`
  * `json`
  * `math`
* **APIs** — Integrated in projects like the quote generator and currency converter to work with real-time data

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

I created this repository to:

* 🔁 Reinforce the fundamentals of Python through hands-on coding challenges
* 🧠 Develop logic-building and algorithmic thinking in everyday problem-solving
* 🛠 Learn how to create tools that solve simple but real-world tasks
* 🎓 Build a foundational portfolio as a stepping stone to full-stack and AI development
* 🌱 Track my growth and share my work with mentors, recruiters, and peers
* 📖 Prepare for more advanced development projects involving databases, backend frameworks, or machine learning in the future

This repository has served as both a personal coding lab and a public display of consistency, focus, and project-based learning.
